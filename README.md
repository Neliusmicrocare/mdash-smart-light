This repository contains the implementation of the full, functional commercial
IoT product under a commercial-friendly Apache 2.0 license.  It can be used as a
reference for creating similar smart products.

This project implements a smart light. For the hardware, we use an ESP32
development board with an LED, which serves as a light. The devboard can be
"shipped" to a customer. A customer provisions it using a mobile app.  You, as a
vendor, have full control over all "shipped" products, including device
dashboard with OTA firmware updates, remote management and usage statistics.
